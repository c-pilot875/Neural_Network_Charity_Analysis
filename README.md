# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

## Modules Used
Tensorflow

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was requested by Alphabet Soup to preditc where to make investments with their foudnation. Using machine learning and neural networks to feature the provided dataset, a binary classifier was created capable of predicitng success of appicant's funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset contained 34,000 organizations along with meta data from the fundings.

## Results:

### Data Processing
1. What variables are considered the targets for the model?
2. What variables are considered to be the features of the model?
3. What variables are neither targets or features, and should be removed from the input data?

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

4. How many nuerons, layers, and activation functions where selected for the neural network model, and why?
